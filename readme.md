This is an implementation of the Fast and Reliable Color Region Merging inspired by Decision Tree Pruning (PSIS) algorithm, that is explained on the website below. I also got the dataset from the same website.

This algorithm is used for image segmentation.

You can find in this folder:

- a python file "PSIS_algorithm.py" which contains the implementation of the algorithm
- a folder "images" which contains all jpg images from the above website, and on which I performed the algorithm
- a python file "main.py" which applies the algorithm on these images 
- a folder "results" which contains the results of the application of the algorithm
